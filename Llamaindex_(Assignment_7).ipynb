From a young age, he had a deep love for nature and would spend hours exploring forests, collecting stones, and observing animals. Unlike other children who were drawn to games and noise, Aasrith enjoyed the calmness of the world around him. One day, he heard a legend from his grandfather about an ancient tree hidden deep in the forest — a tree that was said to grant wisdom to those who found it with a pure heart. Intrigued, Aasrith decided to search for it. With nothing but a small bag, a bottle of water, and his grandfather’s compass, he set out alone into the woods. The journey was not easy — he faced harsh weather, tricky paths, and even had to help a baby deer stuck in a bush. But Aasrith never gave up. After two days of walking and searching, he finally reached a clearing where the tree stood tall and glowing under the sunlight. As he stood before it, he didn’t ask for riches or power — he simply asked to understand the world better. The wind rustled the leaves gently, and Aasrith felt a calmness wash over him. He returned to his village wiser, kinder, and more thoughtful than before. From that day on, everyone looked up to him — not because he found the tree, but because he chose knowledge over pride and helped others with a heart full of warmth.\n",
